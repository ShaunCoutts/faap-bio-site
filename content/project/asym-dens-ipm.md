Scientists achieve good understanding about a system through a mixture of observation, experimentation and mathematical modeling. Unfortunately constructing such models is a real challenge for most free-living populations and communities. There are several reasons for this. First, it is time consuming and expensive to collect a sufficiently large quantity of observational data to robustly parameterize models. Second, most natural systems do not easily lend themselves to experimental manipulation that are invaluable in gaining insight that cannot be reached from observation alone. Third, multiple aspects of populations and communities often change together when the system is perturbed, including the dynamics of population size, average body size of juveniles and adults, gene frequencies and life history traits like life expectancy at birth.  It is only recently that biologists have worked out to simultaneously model the dynamics of populations, genes and traits. These models are called integral projection models.

Although integral projection models offer enormous potential for understanding the dynamics of natural systems, their development is still in its infancy.  In particular the treatment of competition between individuals of the same species is treated naively.  In addition, there is considerable work to be done to use these models to explore the way species within a community interact.  In this proposal we will start by taking already published integral projection models that include competition between individuals of the same species and will use novel methods to analyze them to gain general insight into how different types of competition between individuals simultaneously impacts the dynamics of population size, body size and life history.  

Next, we will use some exceptional detailed experimental data from a freshwater fish community in Trinidad to build models of interacting species.  We will use these models to predict the dynamics of natural streams where dynamics have been observed for many years.  The proposed work is consequently exceptionally good value for money because we will use such extensive existing data.  Through a series of analyses of our models, and potentially some additional experiments, we expect to build models that accurately capture the dynamics of the natural stream community.  By the end of the work we expect to have achieved a better understanding of the dynamics of this system than of any other free-living community under study.

The primary objective of this work is to understand how inter- and intraspecific competition influences eco-evolutionary dynamics defined as the joint dynamics of population size, life history traits and phenotypic characters.   We will modify and analyze existing, published IPMs from species with a wide range of life histories, and will construct and analyze models of guppies and killifish living in a range of different habitats.  

In the fist part of the grant, when we modify and analyze existing single-species integral projection models, we will use models to test the following hypotheses:

1. In animal populations density-dependence in the survival and fertility functions influences population dynamics to a greater extent than density-dependence in development and inheritance functions,

2. Density-dependence in the development and inheritance functions plays a more important role in life history and morphological character dynamics than density-dependence in survival and fertility functions,

3. Trait-mediated density-dependence is always stabilizing, and contest competition strategy will always displace a scramble competition strategy.

In the second part of the grant, when we construct, parameterize and analyze models of interacting interspecific competitors we will test the following hypotheses:

1. The population dynamics of guppies and killifish are more strongly influenced by the effects of interacting species on survival and fertility than on development and inheritance,

2. The morphological and life history dynamics of guppies and killifish are more strongly influenced by the effects of interacting species on development than on survival and fertility,

3. Pronounced interspecific contest competition selects for slower life histories and increased body size compared to interspecific scramble competition.

In testing these hypotheses we will be able to answer numerous questions about eco-evolutionary changes.  These include, but are not limited too:

1. How do different forms of trait-mediated intra-specific competition select for body size?

2. How does inter-specific competition interact with intra-specific competition to determine the body size dynamics of interacting species?

3. Under what conditions does the presence of a competitor species speed up or slow down the life history of a prey species?
