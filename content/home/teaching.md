I am a fellow of the Higher Education Academy. My approach to teaching and supervision of students is to convey my enthusiasm for population biology and evolutionary ecology, using research-led examples to give students a thorough grounding in key concepts. I  believe that learning the basic tools for independent research is essential for undergraduates, and I encourage my students to try new methods of data analysis and quantitative reasoning.

I am the course co-ordinator for the following modules:

- APS135: Introduction to Exploratory Data Analysis and R ([course book](https://dzchilds.github.io/eda-for-bio/))
- APS240: Experimental Design and Statistics with R ([course book](https://dzchilds.github.io/stats-for-bio/))

I am an instructor on the following modules:

- APS342: Evolutionary Ecology
- APS6060: Advanced Statistics for Biologists
