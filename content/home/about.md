# About

I am a Senior Lecturer in the Department of Animal and Plant Sciences at the University of Sheffield. My research group uses model-based approaches to investigate the drivers of population dynamics and natural selection in laboratory and free-living populations. We are particularly keen to understand how demographic, environmental and ecological processes interact to influence these processes. We also develop methods for modelling and analysis of structured populations.
